<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This document serves two purposes. First, it explains what online work is, why it matters practically and why it matters from a pure social science research perspective. Second, it describes the research I have personally done in this space and the research I am doing now or plan to do in the future. It is also discusses my post-graduation work as the staff economist at oDesk, including what drew me to the company, the work I have done there and how the experience is informing my research.</p>

<p>In many social science discplines, theory has played a proportionally larger role than in the natural sciences. One explanation for this difference is that the social sciencess have traditionally been data poor. Collecting data is time-consuming and costly and the data collected is often incomplete or messy. Making matters worse, experimentation is often difficult or unethical and when it is possible, external validity is often poor. The movement of economic and social life towards online markets upends this situation: we can now collect enormous amounnts of highly detailed, complete data at zero marginal cost (the data is collected anyway for operational reasons).</p>
<p>Online labor markets present the opportunity to study economics---particularly labor economics, organicational economics and personnel economics---on a scale heretofore impossible. Whole parts of the economy that are essentially invisible to economists are laid bare and transparent online. For example, my job market paper is about how employers fill their vacancies. In the datasets I created for the paper, we can observe employers deciding whether or not to recruit, deciding how many applications to evaluate, whom to hire and on what terms and how the contracts ultimately progress. This kind of within-the-firm insight would be essentially impossible to acquire in a traditional marketplace setting---nevermind for over 11K vacancies.</p>
<p>In addition to the quantity and quality of data, experimentation is far easier. What makes experimentation easier is that market participants invariably interact though a designed (and hence manipulatable) interface. There is generally no off-platform why to obtain information and make decision. Further, since individuals have personal accounts that they do not share, it is easier to maintain a valid randomization. Experimentation is not only easy---it it also welcomed by the platforms, which are trying to improve their marketplaces and have discovered that randomized trials are one of the best ways to gain information.</p>
<p>On this issue of experimentation: it is not just that experiments are easier, it is that it is possible to manipulate factors that have traditionally been immutable, contextual factors. For example, economists have long assumed that search and matching frictions affect labor market outcomes---but they certainly have not tried manipulating that search and matching technology for the marketplace, say by introducing new tools for searching through availabe jobs or making personalized recommendations. This is just one example of a general pattern in these markets---factors that are thought to be important but modeled as exogenous become subject to the hand of the designer. This creates the opportunity to improve the markets but also understand how these factors affect outcomes and thus ultimately develop a better understanding.</p>
<h2 id="thesis-work">Thesis Work</h2>
<p>From this high As is common in economics, my thesis “Online Labor Markets” was a collection of stand-alone papers.</p>
<p>My thesis was in many ways an exercise in groping towards an understanding of what online labor markets are, how they differ from what we have seen before and where they are heading.</p>
<p>My paper “Online Labor Markets” was my attempt to give a definition of what these things are. It provides a definition of these markets, describes their salient characteristics and sketches out a simple price theory model of how the platforms set a charge.</p>
<p>“The Online Laboratory” (published in Experimental Economcis) was the answer to a question I was continually asked as I began doing experiments on Mechanical Turk: “How can you do valid experiments?” The paper mostly focused on the issues of doing valid causal inference in an online setting. It also contained a number of replications of classic results.</p>
<p>“The Labor Economics of Paid Crowdsourcing” was partially an attempt to show how the techniques of “the online laboratory” could</p>
<p>It also showed that careful empirical work and basic economic theory could shed light onto behavior. Although these markets are new, they are still populated by people and as such, much of existing understanding of people, markets and organizations transfers.</p>
<p>“Peer effects” is organizational economics.</p>
<p>To apply some of the tools of economic analysis to crowdsourcing markets.</p>
<p>Labor economics in particularly provides some valuable tools. To date, there has been surprisingly little empirical research into these online communities. Opportunities abound for high quality empirical work: ease of experimentation, rich sources of data,</p>
<p>What is interesting about online labor markets is that a long of quasi-experimental designs that work poorly with traditional datasets work well in online setting.</p>
<p>Lots of cases of information known to the econometrician but not known to the parties at hand.</p>
<p>There is a body of knowledge to be discovered about how to design decentralized markets and how to augment them with</p>
<p>Running platforms. Crowdsourcing is one manifestation of that.</p>
<p>In “The Condition of the Turking Class” I discussed some of the normative implications of online work. I have been influenced by the work of Lant Pritchett and Michael Clemens on the potentially massive welfare gains to more liberal migration policies. However, I am not very hopeful about this liberalization happening. However, I think of online work as a “hack” around this restriction. It lets people</p>

<p>The paper shows that fairly simple recommendations increased the fill rate (i.e., fraction of vacancies filling) in software and web development jobs by about 17% without crowding-out organic matches. Over the course of the experiment, this generated about 400K in additional transactions; over the course of a year with full implementation, the number is $3.2 million.</p>
