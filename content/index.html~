<strong>About </strong>
<br>

I'm a labor economist and the staff economist at <a href='http://www.odesk.com'>oDesk</a> where 
I am on the "match" / data science team. <br>
My practical work at oDesk focuses on analyzing data and conducting experiments 
with the end goal of creating features and formulating policies that 
promote efficient matching in the marketplace.<br> 
</p>

<p class='well ptext'>
My academic research is primarily focused on issues 
in labor economics and online labor markets in particular.<br>
I also have an interest in the emerging computer science field of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-based_computation'>human computation.</a>
<br>I received my PhD in 2011 and will be going on the academic job market in the fall of 2012.
