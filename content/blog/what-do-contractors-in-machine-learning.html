I saw [this](http://www.quora.com/Machine-Learning/What-do-contractors-in-machine-learning-charge-by-the-hour) question on Quora this morning: "What do contractors in machine learning charge by the hour?"   
{% mark excerpt -%}
Obviously the answer depends on the skill level, but based on the few machine learning contractors 
I've worked with on oDesk, I would guess about 30-40/hour is average. 
However, I wanted to check with some real data. I have access to our full database, but a more useful answer would 
allow people to see how to do this for other skills by simply scraping our search results 
(we have an API, but I don't know how to use it yet and I wanted to try the [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) package).

First step was to reverse-engineer our search syntax and the HTML for profile rates. 
A contractor search of "machine learning" gives this:  

"<https://www.odesk.com/contractors?nbs=1#q=machine+learning>"  

and if I click on the next 10 results, the url is:  

"<https://www.odesk.com/contractors?nbs=1#q=machine+learning&skip=10>"  

I then checked to see what happens if I set "skip=0"---it returns that same thing as the first search URL, 
so now know that I can just write one function that returns the query URL, with parameters of "q" and "skip."  

Next, I needed to find out how the rates are stored. Using Chrome's awesome "Inspect element" feature, 
I found that the rates for the 10 returned results as listed as "rate_1", "rate_2", and so on:

The rest was pretty easy---I just wrote two loops to collect up wages. 
I saw that we had some clear false positives, which I filtered out. 
This actually brings up a big problem on oDesk that we've been working on---namely that until recently, 
we had no standardization of skills, which made it hard to match people or do really good, 
highly specific queries. We've now moved to a closed (but expandable) vocabulary of skills, 
ala StackOverflow which in the long run will make it much easier to do matching and recommendations 
(and little data projects like this). That's a topic for another blog post. 
So, returning to the original question, my answer based on a pretty tiny sample:  

>
  **Min: 16.67  
  Max: 100.0  
  Mean: 39.6983333333**
