My favorite R package, [ggplot2](http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/), recently introduced enhanced support for 
[choropleth maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map). 
I'd like to make some of these kinds of maps with oDesk data, but as a first step,
I thought I'd just plot the locations of all of our India-based contractors by city.
In the plot below, dots size as log-scaled by # of contractors reporting that city. 
The massive light blue dot near Delhi is default coordinate when we're missing the city.

__Here's the associated R code to make this figure:__


    library(ggplot2)
    library(sqldf)
    # using the dataset 'raw' wich is a list of contractors by lat, long
    df <- sqldf("SELECT COUNT(*) AS num, LocLat, LocLong
    FROM raw GROUP BY LocLat, LocLong")
    g <- qplot(LocLong,LocLat, colour=num, size=log(num), data = df)
    png("india.png")
    print(g)
    dev.off()
