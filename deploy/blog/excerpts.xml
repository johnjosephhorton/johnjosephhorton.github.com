&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map&#34;&gt;choropleth maps&lt;/a&gt;. 
I&amp;#8217;d like to make some of these kinds of maps with oDesk data, but as a first step,
I thought I&amp;#8217;d just plot the locations of all of our India-based contractors by city.
In the plot below, dots size as log-scaled by # of contractors reporting that city. 
The massive light blue dot near Delhi is default coordinate when we&amp;#8217;re missing the&amp;nbsp;city.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

buyers and contractors to use when posting jobs and creating profiles. 
The primary motivation for the change was to make it easier for buyers and sellers to find each other: 
without a standardized vocabulary, would-be traders can fail to match simply because they use different terms for the same&amp;nbsp;skill.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

 highlighted &lt;a href=&#34;http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/02/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-talent-in-it-sectors-and-the-like.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; paper by 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://hse-econ.fi/tervio/&#34;&gt;Marko Tervio&lt;/a&gt; as an
 explanation for labor shortages in certain areas of &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;.
 The gist of the model is that in hiring novices, 
firms cannot fully recoup their hiring costs if the novices&amp;#8217; 
true talents will become common knowledge post-hire. 
It&amp;#8217;s a great paper, but what people might not know is that the theory it 
proposes has been tested and found to perform very well. 
For her job market paper, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/pallais&#34;&gt;Mandy Pallais&lt;/a&gt; conducted a large experiment on 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.odesk.com/&#34;&gt;oDesk&lt;/a&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Investors typically hold diverse portfolios of assets, with the goal of reducing risk. 
While diversification is commonplace in investing, most of us have no diversification in our 
labor income streams: we work at one job at a time, for a single employer. However, the &amp;#8220;returns&amp;#8221; 
to a job vary like returns on investments, especially on non-financial dimensions 
(e.g., engagement, learning, co-workers, working conditions). 
As in investing, there is also a significant amount of direct financial risk in holding one job&amp;#8211;the 
firm may impose layoffs or go out of business. Given the similarities between jobs and assets, 
why isn&amp;#8217;t there a similar impetus to diversify, i.e., why don&amp;#8217;t we all hold a portfolio of small jobs 
at the same time, with many different employers&amp;nbsp;[0]?&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                
                &lt;p&gt;One of the most talked about ideas in the world of start-ups is the notion of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product&#34;&gt;minimum viable product&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;MVP&lt;/span&gt;).
 The rationale for &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;MVP&lt;/span&gt; is clear: you don&amp;#8217;t want to build products that customers don’t want, never mind waste 
time polishing and optimizing those unwanted products. &amp;#8220;Minimally viable&amp;#8221; doesn&amp;#8217;t even require the product 
to exist yet&amp;#8211;the viability refers to whether it will give you the feedback you need to see if the project 
has potential. For example, you might do an A/B test where you buy keywords for some new feature, but then just 
have a landing page where people can enter their email address, thereby gauging interest. 
The important thing is that it is market feedback, not just opinions of people near&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;This paper is the first to study vacancies, hires, and vacancy yields at the 
  establishment level in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, a large sample of &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt;   employers.&lt;br /&gt;
  We show that&lt;br /&gt;
 (a) employers rely heavily on other instruments, in addition to vacancy numbers, as they vary hires,&lt;br /&gt;
 (b) the hiring technology exhibits strong increasing returns to vacancies at the establishment level, or both. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We also develop evidence that effective recruiting intensity per vacancy varies over time, accounting for about 35% of movements in aggregate hires.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#8217;ve worked with on oDesk, I would guess about 30-40/hour is average. 
However, I wanted to check with some real data. I have access to our full database, but a more useful answer would 
allow people to see how to do this for other skills by simply scraping our search results

                &lt;p&gt;Some critics of online labor markets mistakenly believe that the platform creators have an 
incentive to keep wages low. Employers have that incentive, but all else equal, the creators of 
online labor markets want to see see wages rise, since almost all of them take a percentage of earnings. 
At least from a revenue standpoint, they should be indifferent between more work at a lower price or less 
work at a higher price, so long as the wage bill stays the same. It would be a different story if the platforms 
could somehow tax employers on the value-added by the platform, but so far, that&amp;#8217;s not&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                &lt;p&gt;A standard pricing strategy in many industries is &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling&#34;&gt;bundling goods&lt;/a&gt;, e.g., 
productivity &amp;#8220;suites&amp;#8221; like Microsoft Office, value meals at fast food restaurants, hotel 
and flight combos, etc. In the labor market, we also see a kind of bundling, though not 
by design: each worker is a collection of skills and attributes that can&amp;#8217;t be broken apart and 
purchased separately by the firm. For example, by hiring me, my company gets my writing, 
meeting attendance, programming, etc.; they can&amp;#8217;t choose to not buy my low-quality expense-report-filing&amp;nbsp;service.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                &lt;p&gt;I recently submitted this blog to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.r-bloggers.com/&#34;&gt;R-bloggers&lt;/a&gt;, which aggregates R-related blog posts. 
It&amp;#8217;s a fantastic site and has been invaluable to me as I&amp;#8217;ve learned R. 
One of my favorite kinds of articles is the hands-on, &amp;#8220;hello world&amp;#8221;-style weekend project that 
dips into a topic/technology, so here&amp;#8217;s my first attempt at one in this&amp;nbsp;style.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                &lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Labor Statistics (&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;BLS&lt;/span&gt;) has an annual budget of over $640 million (&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;FY&lt;/span&gt; 2011), 
a budget  they use to create and then distribute detailed labor market data and analysis to policy makers, 
researchers, journalists and the general public. I can&amp;#8217;t speak to the &amp;#8220;creation&amp;#8221; part of their mission, 
but on the &amp;#8220;distribution&amp;#8221; part, the are failing&amp;#8211;organizations with tiny fractions of their resources do a far better&amp;nbsp;job.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                &lt;p&gt;A few days ago, Laszlo Sandor, one of the economists in my &amp;#8220;economics&amp;#8221; 
Google+ circle posted a photograph showing the Hungarian &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s notes for a speech to parliament. 
As you can see from the picture, the final product was not the result of, uh, careful policy&amp;nbsp;analysis:&lt;/p&gt;            </content>
