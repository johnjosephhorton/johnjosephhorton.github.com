<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">choropleth maps</a>. 
I&#8217;d like to make some of these kinds of maps with oDesk data, but as a first step,
I thought I&#8217;d just plot the locations of all of our India-based contractors by city.
In the plot below, dots size as log-scaled by # of contractors reporting that city. 
The massive light blue dot near Delhi is default coordinate when we&#8217;re missing the&nbsp;city.</p>

 explanation for labor shortages in certain areas of <span class="caps">IT</span>.
 The gist of the model is that in hiring novices, 
firms cannot fully recoup their hiring costs if the novices&#8217; 
true talents will become common knowledge post-hire. 
It&#8217;s a great paper, but what people might not know is that the theory it 
proposes has been tested and found to perform very well. 
For her job market paper, <a href="http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/pallais">Mandy Pallais</a> conducted a large experiment on 
<a href="http://www.odesk.com/">oDesk</a> 
where she essentially played the role of the talent-revealing&nbsp;firm.</p>

<div style='width:740px; padding:10px; text-align:justify;'><p>Investors typically hold diverse portfolios of assets, with the goal of reducing risk. 
While diversification is commonplace in investing, most of us have no diversification in our 
labor income streams: we work at one job at a time, for a single employer. However, the &#8220;returns&#8221; 
to a job vary like returns on investments, especially on non-financial dimensions 
(e.g., engagement, learning, co-workers, working conditions). 
As in investing, there is also a significant amount of direct financial risk in holding one job&#8211;the 
firm may impose layoffs or go out of business. Given the similarities between jobs and assets, 
why isn&#8217;t there a similar impetus to diversify, i.e., why don&#8217;t we all hold a portfolio of small jobs 
at the same time, with many different employers&nbsp;[0]?</p>

<div style='width:740px; padding:10px; text-align:justify;'><p>One of the most talked about ideas in the world of start-ups is the notion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">minimum viable product</a> (<span class="caps">MVP</span>).
 The rationale for <span class="caps">MVP</span> is clear: you don&#8217;t want to build products that customers don’t want, never mind waste 
time polishing and optimizing those unwanted products. &#8220;Minimally viable&#8221; doesn&#8217;t even require the product 
to exist yet&#8211;the viability refers to whether it will give you the feedback you need to see if the project 
has potential. For example, you might do an A/B test where you buy keywords for some new feature, but then just 
have a landing page where people can enter their email address, thereby gauging interest. 
The important thing is that it is market feedback, not just opinions of people near&nbsp;you.</p>

 (a) employers rely heavily on other instruments, in addition to vacancy numbers, as they vary hires,<br />
 (b) the hiring technology exhibits strong increasing returns to vacancies at the establishment level, or both. <br />
<strong>We also develop evidence that effective recruiting intensity per vacancy varies over time, accounting for about 35% of movements in aggregate hires.</strong>&#8221;</p>

<div style='width:740px; padding:10px; text-align:justify;'><p>Some critics of online labor markets mistakenly believe that the platform creators have an 
incentive to keep wages low. Employers have that incentive, but all else equal, the creators of 
online labor markets want to see see wages rise, since almost all of them take a percentage of earnings. 
At least from a revenue standpoint, they should be indifferent between more work at a lower price or less 
work at a higher price, so long as the wage bill stays the same. It would be a different story if the platforms 
could somehow tax employers on the value-added by the platform, but so far, that&#8217;s not&nbsp;possible.</p>

by design: each worker is a collection of skills and attributes that can&#8217;t be broken apart and
