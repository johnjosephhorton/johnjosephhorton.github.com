About
-----
I'm a labor economist and the staff economist at oDesk, an online
labor market. My practical work at oDesk centers on analyzing data and
conducting experiments with the goal of creating features and
formulating policies that promote efficient matching in the
marketplace.

My academic research is primarily focused on issues in labor
economics, organizational economics and market design, particularly in
the context of online labor markets. I received my PhD from Harvard in
2011 and I am currently on the academic job market.
