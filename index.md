About
-----
I am an economist and the staff economist at [oDesk](https://www.odesk.com/info/l/research/), an online labor market.
My practical work at oDesk centers on analyzing data and conducting experiments with the goal of creating features and formulating policies that promote efficient matching in the marketplace.

My academic research is primarily focused on issues in market design, labor economics and organizational economics, particularly in the context of online labor markets.

In the Fall of 2013, I will be joining the Information Systems group at New York University's Stern School of Business as an Assistant Professor of Information Systems.
